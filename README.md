## Overview
The FAQ Backend API is a robust, multilingual API built using Django that allows users to manage Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). This API supports features like retrieving FAQ entries in different languages, a Django-powered admin panel to manage FAQs easily, and a flexible backend that can be extended for various use cases. It is built to handle a variety of FAQ-related operations, such as fetching, adding, and translating FAQs into multiple languages.
## Features
-FAQ Management: Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on FAQ entries.
-Multilingual Support: FAQs can be retrieved in multiple languages (default is English).
-Django Admin Panel: A user-friendly web interface to manage FAQ data easily.
-Database: Uses SQLite by default, with the flexibility to use other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
-API Endpoints: Exposes multiple endpoints to manage FAQ data, including the ability to fetch FAQs in various languages.
## Technologies Used
Technology
- Django	Web framework for backend development
- Django REST Framework (DRF)	API development for FAQs
- SQLite	Default database for local development
- Python 3.x	Backend programming language
- googletrans	API integration for automatic translations
- django-ckeditor	WYSIWYG editor for rich-text support
- Redis 	Caching for improved performance
- pytest	Testing framework for unit tests
## Installation
To get the FAQ Backend API up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/ROHIT-J0SHI/Faqs-backend-test.git
cd Faqs-backend-test

2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

python -m venv venv
3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows :

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux :

source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run Migrations
Set up the database by applying the migrations:

python manage.py migrate
6. Start the Development Server
Run the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

Once the server is up and running, the API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

    }
  ]
}

## Admin Panel
Django comes with a built-in admin panel for managing the FAQ entries. To access the admin panel:

Create a Superuser : Run the following command to create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create a superuser with a username, email, and password.

Access the Admin Panel : Once the superuser is created, start the Django server:

python manage.py runserver
Then, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in your browser.

Log in : Use the superuser credentials you just created to log in to the admin panel.

Manage FAQs : In the admin panel, you will see a section for FAQs . You can add, edit, and delete FAQ entries from here.

## Testing API Endpoints Using Postman
To test the API endpoints, you can use Postman to make GET requests to the endpoints. Here's how to test the API:

1. Test GET /api/faqs/
Open Postman .
Set the request type to GET .
Enter the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/faqs/.
Click Send .
You should receive a response similar to:

{
  "status": "success",
  "total_faqs": 3,
  "faqs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is Django?",
      "answer": "Django is a Python web framework."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "How do I install Django?",
      "answer": "You can install Django using pip: `pip install django`."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Is Django good for beginners?",
      "answer": "Yes, Django is beginner-friendly and well-documented."
    }
  ]
}

2. Test GET /api/faqs/?lang=<language_code>
Open Postman .
Set the request type to GET .
Enter the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/faqs/?lang=hi (or any other language code).
Click Send .
You should receive a response with FAQs in the specified language, like Hindi in this example.

## Running Tests
To run tests for the API, use the following command:

python manage.py test

This will run all the test cases defined in the tests.py file and ensure the API endpoints are functioning correctly.
